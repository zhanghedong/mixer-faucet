Contributors: robfelty

Plugin URI: http://blog.robfelty.com/plugins
Tags: categories, sidebar, widget, navigation
Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 3.2.1
Stable tag: 2.0.2

Adds a widget which uses Javascript to dynamically expand or collapse the set of
posts for each category.

== Description ==
Collapsing Categories creates an expandable list of categories and
subcategories. It can also expand to show posts. The primary usage is as a
widget, but you can also use the code in your theme manually if you wish (see
installation instructions)

= Style changes = 
Version 2.0 introduces a simpler method for styling widgets, and each widget
can be styled separately. Several options are included. If you don't like
those options, you can also use your own css in your theme.

== Installation ==

IMPORTANT!
Please deactivate before upgrading, then re-activate the plugin. 

Unpackage contents to wp-content/plugins/ so that the files are in a
collapsing-categories directory.

= Widget installation = 

 Activate the plugin, then simply go the
Presentation > Widgets section and drag over the Collapsing Categories Widget.


= Manual installation = 

 Activate the plugin, then insert the following into your template: (probably
in sidebar.php). See the Options section for more information on specifying
options.
`
<?php 
echo "<ul class='collapsCatList'>\n";
if (function_exists('collapsCat')) {
  collapsCat();
} else {
  wp_get_categories('your_options_here');
}
echo "</ul>\n";
?>
`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= How do I use different symbols for collapsing and expanding? =

If you want to use images, you can upload your own images to
http://yourblogaddress/wp-content/plugins/collapsing-categories/img/collapse.gif
and expand.gif

There is an option for this.

= I have selected a category to expand by default, but it doesn't seem to work =

If you select a sub-category to expand by default, but not the parent
category, you will not see the sub-category expanded until you expand the
parent category.  You probably want to add both the parent and the
sub-category into the expand by default list.

= I can't get including or excluding to work = 

Make sure you specify category names, not ids.

= There seems to be a newline between the collapsing/expanding symbol and the
category name. How do I fix this? =

If your theme has some css that says something like

#sidebar li a {display:block}

that is the problem. 
You probably want to add a float:left to the .sym class

= No categories are showing up! What's wrong?" =

Are you using categories or tags? By default, collapsing categories only lists
categories. Please check the options in the settings page (or in the widget if
you are using the widget)

=  How do I change the style of the collapsing categories lists? =

As of version 2.0, there are several default styles that come with
collapsing-categories. You can choose from these in the widget settings , or you
can create your own custom style. A good strategy is to choose a default, then
modify it slightly to your needs. 

The following classes are used:
* collapsing - applied to all ul and li elements
* categories - applied to all ul and li elements
* list - applied to the top-level ul
* item - applied to each li which has no sub-elements
* expand - applied to a category which can be expanded (is currently
  collapsed)
* collapse - applied to a category which can be collapsed (is currently
  expanded)
* sym - class for the expanding / collapsing symbol

An example:
`
<ul id='widget-collapscat-15-top ' class='collapsing categories list'>
  <li class='collapsing categories post'><a
    href='http://mysite.com/your-website/about-your-own-site/'
    title='About your own site'>About your own site</a>
  </li>
  <li class='collapsing categories'><span class='collapsing categories expand'
    onclick='expandCollapse(event, "▶","▼", 1, "collapsing categories"); return
    false'><span class='sym'>▶</span>Web hosting</span>
    <ul id='collapsCat-176-15' style="display:none">
      <li class='collapsing categories post'><a 
        href='http://mysite.com/your-website/web-hosting/about-webhosting/'
        title='About webhosting'>About webhosting</a>
      </li>
      <li class='collapsing categories post'><a 
        href='http://mysite.com/products/webhosting-1/'
        title='Webhosting #1'>Webhosting #1</a>
      </li>
      <li class='collapsing categories post'><a 
        href='http://mysite.com/products/webhosting-2/'
        title='Webhosting #2'>Webhosting #2</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li> <!-- ending subcategory -->
`

== Screenshots ==

2. Standard Widget options 
3. Advanced options

== Options ==
Style options can be set via the settings panel. All other options can be set
from the widget panel. If you wish to insert the code into your theme manually
instead of using a widget, you can use the following options. These options
can be given to the `collapsCat()` function either as an array or in query
style, in the same manner as the `wp_list_categories` function.

`$defaults=array(
   'showPostCount' => true,
   'inExclude' => 'exclude',
   'inExcludeCats' => '',
   'showPosts' => true,

= Examples =

`collapsCat('animate=1&catSort=ASC&expand=3&inExcludeCats=general,uncategorized')`
This will produce a list with:
* animation on
* categories shown in alphabetical order
* using images to mark collapsing and expanding
* exclude posts from  the categories general and uncategorized


== Demo ==

I use this plugin in my blog at http://blog.robfelty.com


== CAVEAT ==

Currently this plugin relies on Javascript to expand and collapse the links.
If a user's browser doesn't support javascript they won't see the links to the
posts, but the links to the categories will still work (which is the default
behavior in wordpress anyways)

		  avoid redundancy

* Changed name from Fancy categories to Collapsing categories
* Changed author from Andrew Rader to Robert Felty
* Added triangles which mark the collapsing and expanding features
  That is, clicking on the triangle collapses or expands, while clicking
  on a category links to the category list for the said category.
  This uses html entities (dings) instead of images, for a variety of 
  reasons
* Lists the titles of posts, instead of just listing subcategories
* Removed the rel='hide' and rel='show' tags, because they are not xhtml
  1.0 compliant. Now uses the CSS classes instead
		* MOST IMPORTANTLY -- is compatible with both the pre 2.3 database which
		  uses categories, and the 2.3+ database structure which uses the tag
		  taxonomy
